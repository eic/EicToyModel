This section provides a list of the C++ methods available to users either from the 
ROOT prompt or in the GEANT application or in any other environment where a .root 
file with an EicToyModel class instance was imported.

Be aware that for a better readability several method names have only a shortcut 
representation (e.g. there is a method EtmDetectorStack::add(), but no 
EtmDetectorStack::AddNewDetector() one; EicToyModel::fwd(), but no 
EicToyModel::ForwardEndcap() one, and so on).
